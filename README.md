What it is
================
A simple Chrome app that loads selected images, videos and SWF files on the filesystem, and plays/shows them properly, and allows the user to scroll through them with the arrow keys, or use a slideshow feature if they want.

This is mainly aimed towards people who download a lot of WebMs, (video) SWFs and images and don't want to open all these files in their respective loaders to view them in one go. 

How to install
================
Just clone it/download ZIP and run the HTML file in Chrome. Simple. It MAY work on Firefox, but is not designed to.

If you feel you can contribute, please do but it's a very simple app so there isn't much to contribute :P
