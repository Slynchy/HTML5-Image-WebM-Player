****HTML Image + WebM Player****
================

What it is
================
A simple WIP Chrome app that loads selected files on the filesystem, and plays/shows them properly, and allows the user to scroll through them with the arrow keys.

This is mainly aimed towards people who download a lot of WebMs and images and don't want to set up every WebM to loop, and don't have both hands free (if you get my drift).

How to install
================
Just clone it/download ZIP and run the HTML file in Chrome. Simple. It MAY work on Firefox, but is not designed to.

If you feel you can contribute, please do but it's a very simple app so there isn't much to contribute :P
